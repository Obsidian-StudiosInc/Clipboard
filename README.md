# Clipboard module


This is a clipboard module we created for the Bodhi Linux's e17 fork, Moksha.

The module is an alternative to other clipboard managers like Parcellite, Klipper etc.

Main ambition was to make it light on system resources and bind with Moksha/E desktops.

Main Features:

- Use Clipboard (CTRL + C)
- Use Primary (Selection)
- Save History
- Reverse order
- Items in history
- Label name length

- A float menu with configurable Moksha/E key binding.
